## Running BRMM From Source Code:

The source code is included as `BRMM_latest.py` and for those who want it. All dependencies are listed as `# Dependencies: #` at the top of each script.

To open the script from source, you'll need:
- An IDE (I just used `Visual Studio Code`)
- `Python 3.12`

To actually run the script, you'll need the following dependecies:
  ```
  customtkinter
  pillow (Python Imaging Library)
  googleapiclient
  google_auth_oauthlib
  ```
Instructions to install things via `pip` can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Once you're done with everything, you should be able to simply open the python script and run the application normally.

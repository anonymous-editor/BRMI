## Running BRMM From Source Code:

The source code is included as `BRMM_latest.py` and `BRMM_100.py` for those who want it. All dependencies are listed as `imports` at the top of each script.

To open the script from source, you'll need:
- An IDE (I just used `Visual Studio Code`)
- `Python 3.12`

To actually run the script, you'll need the following dependecies:
- `pip` (Package Manger to install everything below)
- `customtkinter`
- `pillow `
- `gdown`
- `requests`

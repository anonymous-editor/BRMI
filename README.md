This is BRMM, an unoficcial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Load all mod entries in the GUI through the web.
- Choose and remember your Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to subdirectories in that path.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

## Mod Showcase:

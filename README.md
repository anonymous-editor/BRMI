- Load all mod entries in the GUI through the web.
- Choose and remember your Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to those paths.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

BRMM is made entirely in **Python 3.12.2** to handle the file operations and the GUI.

To use BRMM, download `BRMM.zip` through the "Releases" page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/latest).

Once BRMM launches, you should see two windows as shown below:

You can use the terminal to check if your download operations are successful or not.

### Source Code:

Anyone (who wants to improve BRMM) can make pull requests to `BRMM_latest.py`. Be sure to provide a description of what you want to change however, so that it is more likely to be approved. This is a **semi-community project**, so please don't fork the project into another public repository, unless if it is being used to assist with this project.

You can run BRMM from source by using [these instructions](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/blob/main/Documentation/SOURCECODE.md).

### GUI:

You can add mod entries to BRMM through [this `.md` file](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/blob/main/Documentation/JSONEDITING.md). All instructions are provided in the link.

## Credits:
- [KoT3isGood](https://github.com/KoT3isGood): Created a draft of implementing JSON code into BRMM, along with creating other commits.
- [Copper](https://github.com/FateUnix29): Added some configuration values into the original BRMM source code. Later on (about the time of this readme.md update), mostly responsible for 3.2.1. (Everything but image caching, actually.)

Brick Rigs, version 1.6.1+
```


## What is This?

This is BRMM, an unoficcial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Choose and remember your Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to subdirectories in that path.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

## How Does it Work?

BRMM is made entirely in **Python 3.12** to handle the file operations and the GUI.


To use BRMM, download `BRMM1xx_x64.exe` through the "Releases" page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/tag/1.0.0).

# Basic Mod Showcase

HUGE thanks to Andi_pog for making this vid to showcase BRMM.



# Source Code

The source code is included as `BRMM_latest.py` and `BRMM_100.py` for those who want it. All dependencies are listed as `imports` at the top of each script.

To open the script from source, you'll need:
- An IDE (I just used `Visual Studio Code`)
- `Python 3.12`

To actually run the script, you'll need the following dependecies:
- `pip` (Package Manger to install everything below)
- `customtkinter`
- `pillow `
- `gdown`
- `requests`

  Instructions to install things via `pip` can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Possible Improvements:
- Add content wrapping so the app fits more window sizes.
- Add light mode support.
- Improve loading times.
- Improve HiDPI support.
- Improve GUI rendering.

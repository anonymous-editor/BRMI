This is BRMM, an unoficcial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Create a "Mods" folder if it does not exist.
- Download zip files to that mods folder.
- Rename the .zip files to work with BR.
- Extract the .zip files.


## How Does it Work?

BRMM is made entirely in ~Python 3.12~ to handle the file operations and the GUI.

The source code is included as "main.py" for those who want it.

To use BRMM, download `BRMM_x64.exe` through the "Releases" page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/tag/1.0.0).


## Possible Improvements:
- Add content wrapping so the app fits more window sizes.
- Allow users to remove mods from within the app.
- Allow users to choose their Brick Rigs install path.
- Improve loading times.
- Improve GUI rendering.

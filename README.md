## System Requirements:

```
Windows 10/11, 64 bit
Brick Rigs, version 1.6.1+
```

## What is This?

This is BRMM, an unofficial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Load all mod entries in the GUI through the web.
- Choose and remember your Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to those paths.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

## Mod Showcase:

## Install Guide:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your antivirus may prevent you from downloading or running this program. This is a false positive, so feel free to make an exception for BRMM in your antivirus. The source code is included for anyone concerned.

> [!TIP]
> I'd recommend keeping the program files within the `BRMM` folder to avoid glitches when starting the app. 

BRMM is made entirely in **Python 3.12.1** to handle the file operations and the GUI.

To use BRMM, download `BRMM1xx_x64.zip` through the "Releases" page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/tag/latest).

Once BRMM launches, you should see two windows as shown below:

You can use the terminal to check if your download operations are successful or not.

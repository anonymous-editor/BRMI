This is BRMM, an unoficcial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Choose and remember your Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to subdirectories in that path.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

## How Does it Work?

BRMM is made entirely in **Python 3.12** to handle the file operations and the GUI.

The source code is included as "main.py" for those who want it.

To use BRMM, download `BRMM110_x64.exe` through the "Releases" page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/tag/1.0.0).
